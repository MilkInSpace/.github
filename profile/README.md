Rule #1 - Treat others how you'd expect to be treated
Treat others as you'd like to be treated, but sprinkle in some extra kindness and a dash of humor. Remember, laughter is the best seasoning for any conversation!

Rule #2 - Don't be afraid to ask
Don't be afraid to ask questions or seek help. We're all here to support and learn from each other. Even if your question is as odd as "Can penguins do the moonwalk?" â€“ ask, and you shall receive. However, please try to format your message correctly, use triple ticks to format code, and include as much relevant information as possible.
